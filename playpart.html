                <h5>words by Manders</h5>
                MANDERS. [Walks to and fro.] Alas! alas!

                <h5>words by Regina</h5>
                REGINA. What's the matter?

                <h5>words by Engstrand</h5>
                ENGSTRAND.
                [Softly.] 
                 Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see.
                The bird's limed, my girl. [Aloud.] And to think it should be
                my doing that such a thing should be his Reverence's doing!

                <h5>words by Manders</h5> 
                MANDERS.
                 But I assure you, Engstrand--

                <h5>words by Engstrand</h5>
                ENGSTRAND.
                 There wasn't another soul except your Reverence as ever laid
                a finger on the candles down there.

                <h5>words by Manders</h5>
                MANDERS.
                [Stops.] 
                So you declare. But I certainly cannot recollect that
                I ever had a candle in my hand.

                <h5>words by Engstrand</h5>
                ENGSTRAND. 
                And I saw as clear as daylight how your Reverence took the
                candle and snuffed it with your fingers, and threw away the snuff among
                the shavings.
