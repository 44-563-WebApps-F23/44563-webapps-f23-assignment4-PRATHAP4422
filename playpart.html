                MANDERS. [Walks to and fro.] Alas! alas!

                REGINA. What's the matter?
                
                ENGSTRAND. Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see.
                [Softly.] The bird's limed, my girl. [Aloud.] And to think it should be
                my doing that such a thing should be his Reverence's doing!
                
                MANDERS. But I assure you, Engstrand--
                
                ENGSTRAND. There wasn't another soul except your Reverence as ever laid
                a finger on the candles down there.
                
                MANDERS. [Stops.] So you declare. But I certainly cannot recollect that
                I ever had a candle in my hand.
                
                ENGSTRAND. And I saw as clear as daylight how your Reverence took the
                candle and snuffed it with your fingers, and threw away the snuff among
                the shavings.
